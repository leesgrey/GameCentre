Keep track of the things we need to do:
Jing:
1. Work on frontend of Mastermind game so that Hugh can work on the program
2. Work on frontend for matching game (i.e. updating after a move has been made, updating the game after a move has been made.
3. Think about test cases for the code in general
4. Improving the saving and stuff for the games and see if that works properly

Hugh:
1. Working on Mastermind game implementing the game entirely
2. Thinking about test cases for the game
3. Making SlidingTiles solvable

Grey:
1. Working on backend of matching game (i.e. the class that controls the logic of the game
2. Grouping the project into the game specific and general packages so that the project is cleaner for people to read the game
3. Thinking of test cases for the matching game

Andrew:
1. Think of test cases
2. Work on UI stuff relevant to the game
