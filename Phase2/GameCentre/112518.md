# CSC207 Planning session minutes November 2018

## Discussion
Jing and Hugh discussion during meetup.
Realising there is overlap the score and scoreboard with the 3 games. Combining the scoreboards and
scores of the three classes as one rather than using inheritance and avoiding the code smell of
object orientation abusers specifically in the unnecessary usage of OOP concepts (i.e. abstract or
superclass).

Jing drew up the schematics of implementing the Scores and ScoreBoard. Specifically having 3
instances of scoreboard, each for a different game stored as an ser file on the device itself.
Within the 3 instances, there is a string containing the file location of each respective scoreboard
so each instance of the scoreboard will know which one to write to.

Hugh to implement the said changes mentioned above.

To-do list after meeting today:
Jing to finalise the mastermind UI and ensuring it works.
Implementing Firebase to manage users(?) or some alternative way to resolve the issue of keeping
user information secure.

Sieun to finalise matching tiles
